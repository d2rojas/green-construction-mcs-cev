# Technical Limitations and Future Work

## Overview

This document outlines the current limitations of the MCS-CEV optimization model and provides a roadmap for future enhancements. The current implementation prioritizes computational efficiency and model tractability over complete physical realism.

## Current Model Simplifications

### 1. Movement Energy Losses

**Current Implementation:**
```julia
# In src/core/MCSOptimizer.jl lines 119-120
@constraint(model, [m in M, i in N, j in N, t in T], L_trv[m,i,j,t] == 0)
@constraint(model, [m in M, t in T], L_trv_tot[m,t] == 0)
```

**Impact:**
- MCS can move between locations without energy cost
- State of energy remains unchanged during travel
- Unrealistic energy balance for mobile operations

**Future Implementation:**
```julia
# Proposed energy consumption model
L_trv[m,i,j,t] = D[i,j] * k_trv * tau_trv[i,j] * x[m,i,j,t]

# Where:
# D[i,j] = Distance between nodes i and j (miles)
# k_trv = Energy consumption factor (kWh/mile)
# tau_trv[i,j] = Travel time between nodes (hours)
# x[m,i,j,t] = Binary variable for MCS m traveling from i to j at time t
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Remove the constraints that force L_trv to zero
2. Add travel energy consumption to the energy balance constraints
3. Calibrate k_trv based on real MCS specifications
4. Validate against real-world energy consumption data

### 2. Battery Degradation and Temperature Effects

**Current Implementation:**
- Constant charging/discharging efficiency (eta_ch_dch)
- No consideration of battery aging
- No temperature-dependent performance

**Impact:**
- Overestimation of long-term performance
- No consideration of seasonal variations
- Unrealistic battery lifetime predictions

**Future Implementation:**
```julia
# Temperature-dependent efficiency
eta_ch_dch_temp[t] = eta_ch_dch_base * f_temp(T_battery[t])

# Aging effects
eta_ch_dch_aged[t] = eta_ch_dch_temp[t] * f_aging(cycle_count[t], age_days[t])

# Where:
# f_temp() = Temperature efficiency factor
# f_aging() = Aging efficiency factor
# T_battery[t] = Battery temperature at time t
# cycle_count[t] = Cumulative charge/discharge cycles
# age_days[t] = Battery age in days
```

### 3. Grid Constraints and Demand Response

**Current Implementation:**
- Unlimited grid capacity for charging
- No consideration of grid stability
- No demand response programs

**Impact:**
- Unrealistic grid integration scenarios
- No consideration of grid limitations
- Missing demand response opportunities

**Future Implementation:**
```julia
# Grid capacity constraints
@constraint(model, [t in T], 
    sum(P_ch_MCS[m,i,t] for m in M, i in N_g) <= P_grid_max[t])

# Demand response incentives
@constraint(model, [t in T],
    DR_incentive[t] = f_demand_response(grid_load[t], P_ch_total[t]))
```

### 4. Real-time Adaptation

**Current Implementation:**
- Static optimization for entire time horizon
- No real-time updates
- No emergency response scenarios

**Impact:**
- No adaptation to changing conditions
- Missing real-time optimization opportunities
- Limited emergency response capabilities

**Future Implementation:**
- Rolling horizon optimization
- Real-time price updates
- Emergency response protocols
- Dynamic route reoptimization
