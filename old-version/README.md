## Current Limitations and Future Work

### Current Model Simplifications

The current implementation includes several simplifications to maintain computational efficiency and model tractability:

#### 1. **Movement Energy Losses**
- **Current State**: MCS movement energy consumption is set to zero
- **Impact**: MCS can move between locations without energy cost
- **Location**: `src/core/MCSOptimizer.jl` lines 119-120
- **Future Work**: Implement realistic travel energy consumption based on:
  - Distance between nodes
  - MCS speed and efficiency
  - Terrain and road conditions
  - Weather factors

#### 2. **Travel Time Constraints**
- **Current State**: Travel times are considered but don't affect energy consumption
- **Impact**: Movement is instantaneous from an energy perspective
- **Future Work**: Add energy consumption during travel periods

#### 3. **Battery Degradation**
- **Current State**: Battery efficiency remains constant throughout the simulation
- **Impact**: No consideration of battery aging or temperature effects
- **Future Work**: Implement battery degradation models and temperature effects

#### 4. **Grid Constraints**
- **Current State**: Unlimited grid capacity for charging
- **Impact**: No consideration of grid limitations or demand response
- **Future Work**: Add grid capacity constraints and demand response programs

### Planned Enhancements

#### Phase 1: Movement Energy Model
```julia
# Proposed implementation
L_trv[m,i,j,t] = D[i,j] * k_trv * tau_trv[i,j] * x[m,i,j,t]
# Where:
# - D[i,j]: Distance between nodes i and j
# - k_trv: Energy consumption factor (kWh/mile)
# - tau_trv[i,j]: Travel time between nodes
# - x[m,i,j,t]: Binary variable indicating MCS m traveling from i to j at time t
```

#### Phase 2: Advanced Battery Models
- Temperature-dependent efficiency
- State of health (SOH) tracking
- Charging rate limitations based on battery state

#### Phase 3: Grid Integration
- Grid capacity constraints
- Time-of-use pricing optimization
- Demand response integration

#### Phase 4: Real-time Adaptation
- Dynamic route optimization
- Real-time price updates
- Emergency response scenarios
