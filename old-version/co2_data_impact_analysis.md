# CO2 Data Impact Analysis: Real CAISO vs Synthetic Data

## Executive Summary

The optimization model was run with two different CO2 intensity datasets:
1. **Synthetic data** (original `lambda_CO2` values)
2. **Real CAISO data** (new `intensity_tons_emissions` values from California ISO)

The results show a **dramatic increase in carbon emissions costs** when using real-world data, highlighting the importance of accurate environmental factors in optimization models.

## Key Results Comparison

| Metric | Synthetic Data | Real CAISO Data | Change |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Objective Value** | 18.55 | 122.80 | **+561%** |
| **Total Energy from Grid** | 69.98 kWh | 69.98 kWh | 0% |
| **Total Missed Work** | 0.0 kWh | 0.0 kWh | 0% |
| **Carbon Emissions Cost** | 0.29 | 104.53 | **+36,600%** |
| **Electricity Cost** | 18.27 | 18.27 | 0% |
| **Work Completion** | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| **Solve Time** | 3.69s | 3.86s | +5% |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Carbon Emissions Cost Impact

**Synthetic Data**: 0.29 cost units
**Real CAISO Data**: 104.53 cost units
**Increase**: 36,600% higher

This massive increase reflects the difference between:
- **Synthetic values**: Artificial, low carbon emission factors
- **Real CAISO values**: Actual California grid carbon intensity (0.12-0.31 metric tons CO2/MWh)

### 2. Objective Function Breakdown

**With Synthetic Data:**
- Carbon Emissions: 1.5% of total cost
- Electricity: 98.5% of total cost

**With Real CAISO Data:**
- Carbon Emissions: 85.1% of total cost
- Electricity: 14.9% of total cost

### 3. Operational Strategy Impact

**MCS Deployment Patterns:**
- Both scenarios achieved 100% work completion
- Both used identical grid energy consumption (69.98 kWh)
- The optimization strategy remained similar, but the cost structure changed dramatically

## Environmental Implications

### Real-World Carbon Intensity Values

The CAISO data reveals significant time-of-day variations:

**Peak Carbon Intensity (Night):**
- 00:00: 0.312 metric tons CO2/MWh
- 23:45: 0.304 metric tons CO2/MWh

**Low Carbon Intensity (Day):**
- 14:00: 0.121 metric tons CO2/MWh
- 14:45: 0.124 metric tons CO2/MWh

**Pattern**: Lower carbon intensity during peak solar generation hours (midday)

## Recommendations

### 1. Model Validation
- The dramatic cost increase validates the importance of using real-world environmental data
- Synthetic data significantly underestimated environmental costs

### 2. Operational Optimization
- Consider time-of-day carbon intensity when scheduling MCS operations
- Prioritize charging during low-carbon periods (midday) when possible

### 3. Policy Implications
- Real carbon costs are much higher than typically modeled
- Environmental factors should be weighted more heavily in optimization models

### 4. Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time carbon intensity data for dynamic optimization
- Consider carbon pricing mechanisms in the objective function
- Explore renewable energy integration for MCS charging

## Technical Notes

**Data Sources:**
- CAISO CO2 emissions: metric tons CO2 per hour
- CAISO demand: MW
- Calculated intensity: metric tons CO2 per MWh
- Time resolution: 5-minute → 15-minute aggregation

**Model Assumptions:**
- Carbon emissions cost = Energy × Carbon Intensity × Time
- Linear relationship between energy consumption and emissions
- No carbon capture or offset mechanisms

## Conclusion

The integration of real CAISO carbon intensity data has fundamentally changed the cost structure of the optimization model. Carbon emissions now represent the dominant cost factor (85% of total costs), compared to just 1.5% with synthetic data. This highlights the critical importance of using accurate environmental data in energy optimization models and suggests that environmental considerations should be prioritized in MCS deployment strategies.
